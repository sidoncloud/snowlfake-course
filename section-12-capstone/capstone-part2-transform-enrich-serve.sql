-- CAPSTONE, Part 2: Dynamic Tables, Cortex, and Governed Serving
-- Section 12: End-to-End Pipeline on AWS
-- Flow:  raw_tickets -> tickets_clean (Dynamic Table) -> tickets_enriched
--        (Dynamic Table + Cortex) -> tickets_service (governed view + masking)
-- Run in a Snowsight worksheet as ACCOUNTADMIN, after Part 1.

-- 1. CLEAN LAYER, as a Dynamic Table.
--    We flatten the VARIANT into typed columns and normalize region. TARGET_LAG
--    DOWNSTREAM means this table refreshes only as fast as what reads from it.
CREATE OR REPLACE DYNAMIC TABLE tickets_clean
  TARGET_LAG = DOWNSTREAM
  WAREHOUSE  = COURSE_WH
AS
SELECT
  raw:ticket_id::int            AS ticket_id,
  raw:customer_name::string     AS customer_name,
  raw:customer_email::string    AS customer_email,
  raw:product::string           AS product,
  UPPER(raw:region::string)     AS region,

SELECT * FROM tickets_clean ORDER BY ticket_id;

-- 2. ENRICHED LAYER, a Dynamic Table that calls Cortex on the ticket text.
--    SENTIMENT scores the tone from -1 to 1, CLASSIFY_TEXT sorts each ticket into
--    a support category, and SUMMARIZE writes a one line gist. We give this table
--    a generous TARGET_LAG so Cortex is not re-invoked more often than needed;
--    tighten it if you want fresher enrichment and are happy to pay for it.

-- 3. GOVERNANCE, a masking policy on the customer email.
--    Privileged roles see the real address; everyone else sees it masked.

  CASE
    WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('ACCOUNTADMIN') THEN val
    ELSE REGEXP_REPLACE(val, '^[^@]+', '****')

-- 4. SERVING LAYER, a governed view.
--    It shapes the enriched rows for consumers and derives a priority from the
--    sentiment. The masking policy is applied to the email column of this view.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW tickets_service AS
SELECT
  ticket_id,
  customer_name,
  customer_email,
  product,
  region,
  channel,
  created_at,
  category,

-- 5. A throwaway analyst role to prove the masking works.

GRANT USAGE  ON DATABASE  SNOWFLAKE_LABS                   TO ROLE capstone_analyst;
GRANT USAGE  ON SCHEMA    SNOWFLAKE_LABS.CAPSTONE          TO ROLE capstone_analyst;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW      SNOWFLAKE_LABS.CAPSTONE.tickets_service TO ROLE capstone_analyst;
SET capstone_user = CURRENT_USER();
GRANT ROLE capstone_analyst TO USER IDENTIFIER($capstone_user);

-- 6. As ACCOUNTADMIN you see the real email and the full serving row.
SELECT ticket_id, customer_email, category, priority
FROM tickets_service
ORDER BY ticket_id;

-- 7. As the analyst the email comes back masked, everything else is intact.
USE ROLE capstone_analyst;
USE WAREHOUSE COURSE_WH;
SELECT ticket_id, customer_email, category, priority
FROM SNOWFLAKE_LABS.CAPSTONE.tickets_service
ORDER BY ticket_id;
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- Cleanup (optional, run this when you are done to remove what the lab created):
-- DROP VIEW IF EXISTS tickets_service;
-- DROP DYNAMIC TABLE IF EXISTS tickets_enriched;
-- DROP DYNAMIC TABLE IF EXISTS tickets_clean;
-- DROP MASKING POLICY IF EXISTS email_mask;
