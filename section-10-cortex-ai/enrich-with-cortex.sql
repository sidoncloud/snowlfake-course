-- 1. Raw text landing in a pipeline: incoming support messages, some non-English.

SELECT * FROM support_messages ORDER BY message_id;

-- 4. CLASSIFY_TEXT: sort each message into one of our support categories.
--    It returns an object; the chosen category is in the :label field.

-- 6. EXTRACT_ANSWER: pull a specific answer out of the text.
--    It returns an array of {answer, score}; take the first answer.

--    A small model is plenty for routing, and it is the cheaper choice.

--    New rows landing in support_messages get scored and routed automatically.
